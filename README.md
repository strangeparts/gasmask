Open Source Gas Mask

NOTE: This is a preliminary design, that still needs testing and refinement.  Do not rely on this to save your life just yet.

This is a 3d printable gas mask design.  It's printed in 3 parts - the main mask, the canister, and a gasket to hold the face shield in.  The face shield is cut from a piece of clear plastic.

The filter material is activated charcoal - you can buy this at any pet store.  Put a layer of cotton batting int he bottom of the canister, then fill with activated charcoal, then put another layer of cotton on top, and screw the canister into the mask.
