# FullyPrintedValve

This valve was designed to be completely 3D printed, in the event that no other materials are available. The seal is pretty good, but not perfect, and requires testing to determine whether it will fully protect the wearer.

## Assembly

The valve comes in 3 parts - be sure these are separated into separate objects when printing:

* The main body which consists of the threads, tightening knob, and valve chamber
* The diaphragm, which is a 0.2mm thin disc with a ring of holes
* The inlet plate, which is a 2mm thick disc with holes in the center

To assemble:

1. Print all 3 parts in the default orientation. The tightening knob should be on the build plate with the threaded end pointing upwards.
2. Let the build plate cool before removing to prevent warping the sealing surfaces.
3. If the build plate is flexible, flex it in 2 directions by turning the build plate 90 degrees in between. Repeat until the main body and inlet place can be lifted off.
4. Continue bending the plate until the diaphragm can slide freely off of the bed. If the build plate is not flexible, try to remove the diaphragm without bending it if possible.
5. Place the diaphragm into the threaded end of the main body, so that it rests on top of the pins inside. The smooth side of the diaphragm (the side that was face down on the bed) should be facing upwards.
6. Be sure the smooth side of the diaphragm is facing upwards for the best seal quality.
7. Press fit the inlet plate into the hole to capture the diaphragm. Ensure that the inlet plate is oriented so the smooth side is facing down, towards the diaphragm.
8. Add glue if possible to help form an airtight seal between the inlet plate and main body.

## Usage Tips

* Refer to the documentation for your face mask for the proper location to install the valve.
* The NATO connector specifies a gasket to be used at the bottom of the female thread. If this gasket is not present, consider using an appropriate glue to form an airtight seal.
