# Reference

These are bits and pieces we used in building the mask and accesories!

The female thread has the stop on it as per specification, to guarantee a seal with all canister designs.

The male thread was also shortened to not be pointlesly long when using the shorter female thread. Also keep in my mind that only one side is chamfered for optimal insertion.
