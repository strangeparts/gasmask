This is where the Angular mask concept lives!
it contains half face, and full face options, available to be printed or folded from sheets. folded options are currently in beta and are not yet released. - any help would be appreciated!
both the full, and half face variants should be printable on most 3d printers. They are also available in "DIY filter" and "threaded" variants. 
this allows you to attach a DIY - bottle filter as can be seen in /ptinted/Making DIY FIlters.txt
STEP files are available to edit, and stl files are available to print. see below for assembly diagrams, and instructions. the main STEP - below contains all variants as seperate components,including the folded ones.
